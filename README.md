# AI-Powered Fake News Detector

An advanced Python tool leveraging Together AI's LLaMA Vision model and Tavily's fact-checking API to detect fake news through multi-modal analysis of text and images, cross-referencing claims against reliable sources.

## Setup

### 1. API Key Configuration
1. Create accounts on [Together AI](https://api.together.ai) and [Tavily](https://tavily.com)
2. Generate API keys from both platforms
3. In the `src` directory, create or update the `.env` file:
   ```env
   TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_api_key_here
   TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key_here
   ```

### 2. Environment Setup 

#### Option A: Direct Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Option B: Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv env
# Activate the environment (OS-specific)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Add test images to the `data` directory
2. Execute the script:
```bash
cd src
python main.py
```

The tool will:
- Analyze image-text consistency
- Fact-check claims using reliable sources
- Assess the likelihood of fake news
- Provide detailed reasoning for the assessment

## Example Output
```json
{
  "image_text_match": "Yes",
  "image_text_match_confidence": 0.8,
  "fact_check": "Supported",
  "fact_check_confidence": 0.75,
  "fake_news": "No",
  "fake_news_confidence": 0.9,
  "reasoning": "The image analysis supports the news text with 80% confidence. Fact-checking results are supported with 75% confidence. Based on this analysis, the news is determined to be authentic with 90% confidence.",
  "fact_check_results": [
    {
      "title": "Fact Check: Trump's Relations with India",
      "url": "https://example.com/fact-check",
      "content": "Verified positive relations between Trump and Indian government.",
      "score": 0.85
    }
  ],
  "image_analysis": {
    "description": "Image shows Trump meeting with Indian officials.",
    "confidence": 0.8
  }
}
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Features
- Multi-modal analysis (image and text)
- Integration with Tavily's advanced search API
- Focused search across reputable news and fact-checking sources
- Detailed assessment with confidence scores
- Asynchronous processing for improved performance

## How It Works
1. Processes input news claim and associated image
2. Utilizes Tavily API for fact-checking against reliable sources
3. Analyzes image content using LLaMA Vision model
4. Combines analyses to:
   - Evaluate image-text consistency
   - Cross-reference claims with fact-checking results
   - Generate a comprehensive assessment with reasoning
